# Target-Shapley-effects
Software and data related to the paper "Shapley effects estimation in reliability-oriented sensitivity analysis with dependent inputs by importance sampling".

## Repository structure

The folder "cross_entropy" contains the softwares related to the cross-entropy algorithms in order to estimate the failure probability and to compute an adapted importance sampling auxiliary distribution.

The folder "shapley_estimators" contains the software related to the estimation of the target Shapley effects. The main functions can be found in the file "ROSA_shapley_effects.py".

The folder "numerical_tests" contains the implementation of the test cases from the article as well as the corresponding data.
